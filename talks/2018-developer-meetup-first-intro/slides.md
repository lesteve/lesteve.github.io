### Motivation

* a lot of researchers are coding as part of their research and face common problems <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* maybe someone in the building has faced the same problem as yours and has already found way to solve it  <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* maybe it is the person that you crossed in the elevator  <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* let's start discussions and learn from each other! <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

==

### Story time (1/2)

* background in Particle Physics, C++ to run my analysis, including plots <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* the code was not very nice (copy and paste) but it kind of works right? <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* towards the end of my PhD I discovered that there were Python
bindings for the analysis package that we were using (ROOT) <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* why did nobody tell me about this before? <!-- .element class="fragment" -->


==

### Story time (2/2)

* we were running most of the bulk of our analysis on a data center  <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* edit files with emacs: emacs + ssh -X, quite slow on some days, but you know it kind of works right? <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* and then I was told about sshfs <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* one question: why so much suffering? <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

<!-- Random walk, which is part of research, some of it does not have to be this -->
<!-- way at least not completely, there are some beaten paths and you should not walk -->

==

### What we want to get out of it?

* build a local community of coders with all kinds of skills and backgrounds
 <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* share our favourite tricks and tools, success and horror stories, etc...
 <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* gather good coding habits and practices
 <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

==

### Selfish motivations

SED (Service d'Expérimentation et de Développement)

* one of the mission of the SED team is to promote development best practices
* better software better research + easier technology transfer
* use this meetup to get some insights about what people are doing and
  which tutorials/training we can run, e.g. git or other tools. 

==

### What we have in mind

* ~ monthly meetup
 <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* 1 or 2 presentations/tutorials (~30-40 minutes total) <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* a few lightning talk (~2-5 minutes) to encourage anyone to give a short 
  about the topic of their choice. <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* encourage informal discussions during the talks <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* cakes to fuel discussions further <!-- .element class="fragment" -->


==

### Topics?

* anything really ... as long as it is (loosely) related to software development <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* here is this nice tool/a configuration trick/language I discovered recently
  and that makes my life so much easier <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* interesting article that you want to share <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* do your best to make it relevant to people outside your field <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
  
==

### Feed-back? 

* this meetup is the first one we organise, so most of it is very open
  (format/content, etc ...) <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* suggestions more than welcome, let us know what
  you think! <!-- .element class="fragment" -->
* what do you want to hear/talk about? what would make your life easier? <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

<!-- + Goal of this meetup in general and the first one in particular: start -->
<!--   discussions. interesting, so you say you do it like this but are you aware of -->
<!--   this limitation, or have you bumped into this problem that we don't really -->
<!--   have a work-around for. Oh yeah I remembered we tried this a few years ago -->
<!--   and we ended up giving up for this and this reason. -->
