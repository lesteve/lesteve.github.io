# Software Carpentry: teaching as a community effort

http://open-source-innovation-spring.org/scikit-learn-day/

Abstract:

> Since 1998, Software Carpentry has been teaching researchers in science, engineering, medicine, and related disciplines the computing skills they need to get more done in less time and with less pain. We'll be talking about the teaching (what and how) and the community effort to share the work and keep the workshops going.

## Goals:


1) SC approach to teaching (what and how) and the community effort to share the work and keep the workshops going.
2) find a few motivated persons (instructors and helpers) to continue SWC Paris
3) show how a community centered around common goals (teaching) rather than code can work (aka importing open source model to other non-computer-science areas)

## what is SC (5 min)

* show of hands: 1) Raise of hand if you have heard of Software Carpentry. 2) Raise your hand if you attended (either as a instructor, helper or student) one of SC workshops.
* international organisation whose mission is to help scientists who are programming badly to program better,
* brief history
    * inititated in 1998 by Greg Wilson as week-long workshops for LANL. First materials publisehd in 2004. 
    * most scientists don't get formal training in best practices of software engineering, yet they program and use advanced computational strategies
    - "It grew out of frustration he [Greg Wilson] had working with scientists who wanted to run before they could walk, i.e., to prallelize complex programs that were not broken down into self-contained functions, that did not have any automated tests and that wre not under version control"
    - "I started SC because I wanted to share solutions to problems I encountered myself and to learn from others about their problems and solution. At the beginning I tried to adapt and teach about ‘best practices’ of software engienneering like object-oriented programming and design patters (not being software engineer myself)."
    - I co-organised summer school 'Advanced Scientific Programming in Python’ in Berlin in 2009, since then it became an annual event
    - "However, I quickly realised that PhD and master students in our (computational!) lab could spend hours implementing even simple analyses like summing rows in a file"
* other common problems:
    - repeat the same analysis by hand on tens of files and save the results in spreadsheet or word document.
    - copy files and block of code as a form of 're-use' and versioning.
    - use emails to send new versions of code 
* therefore SC focuses now on 2-day workshops (introduced in 2012) -- 30% of effort give 70% of scientific computing literacy

* today SC focuses on best practices:
    - automation
    - version control
    - designing re-usable programs
    - collaboration and reproducibility
    - core lessons

* The foundation was set up in 2014.

* recently Data Carpentry was created whose mission is to help scientists manage and analyze their data

## Typical workshop (3 min):
(I plan to show the webpage and explain a bit about the schedule, installation etc. However to keep it quick, I may just emphasise differences from standard programming training classes)

* what is special about SC teaching method:
    * software running in students environment
    * use of live coding
    * demos are interspersed by demonstrations
    * use sticky notes to call a helper
    * use of many forms of feedback (sticky notes, etherpad, surveys)
    * evidence-based teaching -- SC surveys and publications

* instructors training and certification:
    * required for all certified instructors
    - focus on evidence-based teaching strategies
    - improve the sense of community


## SC as an open source community - similarities / differences (3 min):
(Related to Goal 3. To keep it short I will put the main characteristic of OSS communities on a slide and just explain how they relate to SC)

- [Common Characteristics of an Open Source Community](https://blogs.s-osg.org/common-characteristics-of-an-open-source-community/) by Ben Lyold Pearson
* members of SC community share goals (make the world a better place) and interests (computation and teaching)
* very inclusive - no need to be a programmer
* SC instructors around the world
* centered around collaboratively edited, reusable lessons:
    - CreativeCommons-licensed - can be re-used for non-SC workshops
    - lesson templates for new lessons
    - example — Python lesson: 89 contributors, ~1000 commits, 120 PRs merged, 200 forks, 4000 lines of lesson content
    + instructors are encouraged to adapt the materials for their needs and contribute back their changes
* teaching as performance art:
    - everyone teaches differently the same lesson
    - needs constant feedback from others
* communication: blog, mailing lists, Github issue tracker, videoconferences, in-person meetings
* structured organisation (local SC community, global community, advisory boards etc.)


* shares some of its weaknesses: lengthy discussions about "technicalities"
      
## Locally (4 min)

* introduce Paris-based instructors
* map of workshops
* basic stats on workshops, instructors, 6 instructors recently certified,
* all of our workshops filled within few hours after opening of registration
* BBBQ this week and new SC-style lessons
* what has been already achieved? 
* infographics: field, career and gender
* sample feedback, results of surveys, testimonials
        + “I had the chance to work with some of the participants after the workshop. Although, I do see that their knowledge and confidence with bash, git or python improved, after the course they would go back to their original habits of running their analysis manually and keeping versions of their files in directories (or commenting un-used/experimental code). There is still much work to do to enhance the retention of the information and putting it in practice”

* problems:
    - different levels of participants
    - some lessons might be motivated with better (domain-specific) examples

* how to join us? how to organise a workshop? 
    * join our mailing list, GH organisation
    - two ways to organise workshop -- self-organised or SCF-organised (SCF looks for instructors)
    - ask me about our conditions

* acknowledge supporting institutions (hosts, sponsors, instructors’ affiliations, funding agencies)

* what is next?
    - workshop at your institute,
    - possibly other French cities,
    - workshops in French?
    - ASPP (aka G-node) school in Reading, UK
    - partnership programme - can we find an insitute interested in becoming a SCF partner [3] (it means extra charges, but we can also train more instructors)
