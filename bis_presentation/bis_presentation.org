try to learn a two-way mapping between brain activity and cognitive function

Disclaimer: datasets up to ~TB but more typically 1-100GB

* Why Python?

- interactive language, key for data exploration
- General purpose language
- Easy to read/write
- mature scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, etc ...)
- Performance through numpy, cython

* scikit-learn vision
- an enabler: machine learning without having to learn the machinery
- High quality Pythonic software library: interfaces designed for users
- community-driven development: BSD licensed with diverse contributors

* scikit-learn overview
- very rich feature set:
  + supervised learning: decision trees, linear models, SVM, ...
  + unsupervised learning: clustering, dictionary learning, ...
  + model selection: built-in cross-validation, parameter optimization
- performance matters
# - used in production by data-driven companies (Spotify, Evernote, New
#   York Times, ...)

For more details see [[http://scikit-learn.org/]]

* Strategies for tackling big data

- feature reduction
  + randomized projections: embedding into a lower dimensional space
    that conserves distances
  + feature clustering: on images super-pixel strategy

- online learning: learn one sample at a time, e.g. IncrementalPCA

* joblib

- never recompute the same thing twice. Cache results of costly
  computations to disk
- fast hashing of input numpy arrays
- helper functions for parallel computing. memmapping input arrays
  allow to share input data across workers.

* Hardware aspects
- Parietal team workhorse (~15 k€): single server with 384 GB RAM, 48 cores, 70
  TB storage (SSD cache on RAID controller)
- gets the work done faster than our 800 CPU cluster

* Summary
- scikit-learn: machine learning library focused on usability and
  performance
- different strategies can be used to scale to big data
- single big memory server can outperform cluster depending on your
  exact use case
